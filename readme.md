# Classifcation Project

### Project Description:
- Goal 1: find drivers of churn for Telco customers

- Goal 2: build a machine learning model that accurately predicts customer churn

- The project will include data acquisition, data cleaning / wrangling, data exploration, machine learning modeling for predicting customer churn, and predictions of customer churn based on the current telco dataset

- The project wil conclude with a final report that summarizes the project's findings and includes the code necessary to replicate the findings and a .csv file with predictions of churn based on the best performing model
